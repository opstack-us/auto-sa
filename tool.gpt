You have just received an alarm. The information about the alarm is contained in the following env vars:
ALARM_NAME
INSTANCEID

1. Retrieve the ip of the instance using the id stored in the INSTANCEID env var. Use the getinstip tool providing it the instanceid as an argument.
2. Determine which IP to ssh to by checking connecivity
3. SSH into the instance using the ip and determine the cause of the ALARM_NAME.
4. Try up to 5 diagnostic commands (use sudo)
5. Attempt to resolve the issue
6. Output the diagnosis if any and steps taken to resolve.
